    <h5><a id="2-At-W">At-Will Employment</a></h5>

When changes are made to the policies and guidelines contained herein, the Practice will endeavor to communicate them in a timely fashion, typically in a written supplement to the handbook or in a posting on Practice bulletin boards.</div>

    <h5><a id="2-Equa">Equal Opportunity Statement</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice is an Equal Opportunity Employer that does not discriminate on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, sex or gender (including pregnancy, childbirth and pregnancy-related conditions), gender identity or expression (including transgender status), sexual orientation, marital status, military service and veteran status, physical or mental disability, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by applicable federal, state or local laws and ordinances. The Practice executive leadership team is dedicated to this policy with respect to recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, transfer, training, compensation, benefits, employee activities, access to facilities and programs and general treatment during employment.<br><br> The Practice will endeavor to make a reasonable accommodation of an otherwise qualified applicant or employee related to an individual’s: physical or mental disability; sincerely held religious beliefs and practices; and/or any other reason required by applicable law, unless doing so would impose an undue hardship upon the Practice’s business operations.<br><br> Any applicant or employee who needs an accommodation in order to perform the essential functions of the job should contact People Operations to request such an accommodation. The individual should specify what accommodation is needed to perform the job and submit supporting documentation explaining the basis for the requested accommodation, to the extent permitted and in accordance with applicable law. The Practice will then review and analyze the request, including engaging in an interactive process with the employee or applicant, to identify if such an accommodation can be made. The Practice will evaluate requested accommodations, and as appropriate, identify other possible accommodations, if any. The individual will be notified of the Practice’s decision regarding the request within a reasonable period. The Practice treats all medical information submitted as part of the accommodation process in a confidential manner.<br><br> Any employees with questions or concerns about equal employment opportunities in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of People Operations. The Practice will not allow any form of retaliation against individuals who raise issues of equal employment opportunity. If employees feel they have been subjected to any such retaliation, they should contact People Operations. To ensure our workplace is free of artificial barriers, violation of this policy including any improper retaliatory conduct will lead to discipline, up to and including discharge. All employees must cooperate with all investigations conducted pursuant to this policy. This policy governs all areas of employment, including hiring, promotion, assignment and discharge.</div>

    <h5><a id="2-Dive">Diversity, Equity & Inclusion</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice is committed to actions that build on the strengths of our current workforce and continually enhance the diversity of our organization. The Practice is committed to fostering, cultivating and preserving a culture of diversity, equity and inclusion.<br><br> Employees are the most valuable asset we have. The collective sum of the individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self-expression, unique capabilities and talent that our employees invest in their work represents a significant part of not only our culture, but our reputation and Practice achievements as well.<br><br> We embrace and encourage our employees’ differences in age, color, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our employees unique.<br><br> The Practice’s diversity initiatives are applicable—but not limited—to our practices and policies on recruitment and selection; compensation and benefits; professional development and training; promotions; and the ongoing development of a work environment and culture built on the premise of gender and diversity equity that encourages and enforces:</div>

    <div class="q">
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Respectful communication and cooperation between all employees.</li>
            <li>Teamwork and employee participation, permitting the representation of all groups and employee perspectives.</li>
            <li>Work/life balance.</li>
            <li>Employer and employee contributions to the communities we serve to promote a greater understanding and respect for diversity.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="q">All employees of the Practice have a responsibility to treat others with dignity and respect at all times. All employees are expected to exhibit conduct that reflects inclusion during work, at work functions on or off the work site, and at all other Practice-sponsored and participative event. All employees are also required to attend and complete annual diversity awareness training to enhance their knowledge to fulfill this responsibility. Any employee found to have exhibited any inappropriate conduct or behavior against others may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including a suspension without pay or termination. Employees who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the Practice’s diversity policy and initiatives should seek assistance from the People Operations Department.</div>

    <h5><a id="2-Gend">Gender Affirming Acceptable Terms</a></h5>
    <div class="q"><u>Gender Identity</u>: A person’s internal, deeply-felt sense of being male, female, or something other or in-between, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth. Everyone has a gender identity. Gender expression: An individual’s characteristics and behaviors (such as appearance, dress, mannerisms, speech patterns, and social interactions) that may be perceived as masculine or feminine.<br><br>
        <u>Transgender</u>: An umbrella term that can be used to describe people whose gender identity and/or expression is different from their sex assigned at birth. A person whose sex assigned at birth was female but who identifies as male is a transgender man (also known as female-to-male transgender person, or FTM). A person whose sex assigned at birth was male but who identifies as female is a transgender woman (also known as male-to-female transgender person, or MTF). Some people described by this definition do not consider themselves transgender. They may use other words, or may identify simply as a man or woman. A person does not need to identify as transgender in order for the Practice’s nondiscrimination policies to apply to them.<br><br>
        <u>Gender Non-Conforming</u>: This term describes people who have, or are perceived to have, gender characteristics and/or behaviors that do not conform to traditional or societal expectations. It is important to keep in mind that these expectations can vary across cultures and may change over time.<br><br>
        <u>Transition</u>: The process of changing one’s gender from the sex assigned at birth to one’s gender identity. There are many different ways to transition. For some people, it is a complex process that takes place over a long period of time, while for others it is a one- or two-step process that happens more quickly. Transition may include “coming out” (telling family, friends, and coworkers); changing a name and/or sex on legal documents; and, for many transgender people, accessing medical treatment such as hormones and surgery.<br><br>
        <u>Sexual Orientation</u>: A person’s physical or emotional attraction to people of the same and/or other gender. Straight, gay, and bisexual are some ways to describe sexual orientation. It is important to note that sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and expression. Transgender people can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or straight, just like non-transgender people.<br><br>
        <u>LGBTQ</u>: A common abbreviation that refers to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.<br><br> The Practice believes that everyone has . . .
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Sex Assigned at Birth</li>
            <li>Gender Identity</li>
            <li>Gender Expression</li>
            <li>Sexual Orientation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h5><a id="2-Comm">Commitment to Transgender Employees</a></h5>
    <h6>Name and Pronouns</h6>
    <div class="q">An employee has the right to be addressed by the name and pronoun that correspond to the employee’s gender identity, upon request. A court-ordered name or gender change is not required. The intentional or persistent refusal to respect an employee’s gender identity (for example, intentionally referring to the employee by a name or pronoun that does not correspond to the employee’s gender identity) can constitute harassment and is a violation of this policy. In cases where coworkers are unsure of a pronoun preference, the Practice advises employees to politely ask the coworker how they would like to be addressed.</div><br>

    <h6>Restroom Accessibility</h6>
    <div class="q">All of Practice’s restroom facilities that dwell within a Wellness home are gender neutral. In cases where the Practice shares restroom space with other organizations, efforts will be made to advocate making restrooms gender neutral and/or ensuring that employees have the right to use a restroom that corresponds to the employee’s gender identity, regardless of the employee’s sex assigned at birth.</div><br>

    <h6>Privacy</h6>
    <div class="q">Transgender employees have the right to discuss their gender identity or expression openly, or to keep that information private. The transgender employee gets to decide when, with whom, and how much to share their private information. Information about an employee’s transgender status (such as the sex they were assigned at birth) can constitute confidential medical information under privacy laws like HIPAA. Executive Leadership, People Operations, Managers, Supervisors and/or coworkers shall not disclose information that may reveal an employee’s transgender status or gender non-conforming presentation to others. That type of personal or confidential information may only be shared with the transgender employee’s consent and with coworkers who truly need to know to do their jobs.<br><br> It is a violation of the Practice’s Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Policy to discriminate in any way (including, but not limited to, failure to hire, failure to promote, or unlawful termination) against an employee because of the employee’s actual or perceived gender identity. Additionally, it is unlawful and contrary to this policy to retaliate against any person objecting to, or supporting enforcement of legal protections against, gender identity discrimination in employment. Our Practice is committed to creating a safe work environment for transgender and gender non-conforming employees. Any incident of discrimination, harassment, or violence based on gender identity or expression will be given immediate and effective attention, including, but not limited to, investigating the incident, taking suitable corrective action, and providing employees and staff with appropriate resources.</div>

    <h5><a id="2-Ethi">Ethics Code</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice will conduct business honestly and ethically wherever operations are maintained. We strive to improve the quality of our services, products, and operations and will maintain a reputation for honesty, fairness, respect, responsibility, integrity, trust, and sound business judgment. Our managers and employees are expected to adhere to high standards of business and personal integrity as a representation of our business practices, at all times consistent with their duty of loyalty to the Practice. Our reputation is a most valuable asset, and we must continually earn the trust, confidence and respect of our patients and the community.<br><br> We expect that officers, directors, and employees will not knowingly misrepresent the Practice and will not speak on behalf of the Practice unless specifically authorized. The confidentiality of trade secrets, proprietary information, and similar confidential commercially-sensitive information (i.e., financial or sales records/reports, marketing or business strategies/plans, product development, customer lists, patents, trademarks, etc.) about the Practice or operations, or that of our customers or partners, is to be treated with discretion and only disseminated on a need-to-know basis (see policies relating to privacy).<br><br> Violation of the Code of Ethics can result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment. The degree of discipline imposed may be influenced by the existence of voluntary disclosure of any ethical violation and whether or not the violator cooperated in any subsequent investigation.</div>

    <h5><a id="2-Back">Background Checks</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Offers of employment for certain positions at the Practice may be contingent upon the results of a thorough background check. A background check is performed to protect the interests of the Practice and that of its employees and patients and to comply with certain requirements. Background checks will be conducted on licensed providers and employees as required. Background checks may include prior employment verification, professional reference checks, and education confirmation. New hires must complete a background check authorization form and return it to People Operations. People Operations will notify the Chief Wellness Officer of the background check results. In instances where negative information is obtained, the Chief Wellness Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Director, People Operations will assess the potential risks and liabilities related to the job's requirements and determine whether the individual may be hired. If a decision not to hire or promote a candidate is made based on the results of a background check, there are certain Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requirements that will be handled by People Operations in conjunction with the background screening service. The Practice reserves the right to modify this policy at any time without notice.</div>

    <h5><a id="2-Poli">Policy Against Workplace Harassment</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice has a strict policy against all types of workplace harassment, including sexual harassment and other forms of workplace harassment based upon an individual’s actual or perceived age (40 and older), race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, pregnancy (including childbirth, lactation, and related medical conditions), marital status, order of protection status, citizenship status, employment status, arrest and conviction information, credit history, crime victim status, physical or mental disability, genetic information (including testing and characteristics), sexual orientation, veteran status, uniformed servicemember status, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws. All forms of harassment of, or by, employees, non-employees including contractors and consultants, vendors, visitors, customers, and clients are strictly prohibited and will not be tolerated. If after an investigation, an employee is found to be in violation of this policy the employee will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment depending on the circumstances surrounding the incident.</div>

    <h5>Sexual Harassment</h5>
    <div class="q">“Sexual harassment” is defined as any (i) unwelcome sexual advances or unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature; (ii) requests for sexual favors or conduct of a sexual nature when (1) submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual’s employment;, or (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for any employment decision affecting the individual;, or (3) such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment; or (iii) sexual misconduct, which means any behavior of a sexual nature which also involves coercion, abuse of authority, or misuse of an individual’s employment position. An individual’s work environment is not limited to the physical location where an individual is assigned to perform work duties.<br><br> Sexual harassment can occur in many ways. It may involve unwelcome romantic or sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, visual materials, social media posts, verbal comments, and/or physical contact of a sexual nature, regardless of gender or gender identity. Involved parties, either victim or harasser, could be a co-worker, subordinate, manager/supervisor, contractor, or even a customer.<br><br> Such conduct is a violation of this policy, even in instances where the offending employee believed they were acting jokingly. Such communications, comments, actions of a sexual nature, or unwelcome advances are prohibited at the Practice whether or not other employees were offended.<br><br> While it is not possible to identify every act that constitutes or may constitute sexual harassment, the following are some examples of sexual harassment:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Unwelcome requests for sexual favors,</li>
            <li>Lewd or derogatory comments or jokes,</li>
            <li>Comments regarding sexual behavior or the body of another,</li>
            <li>Sexual innuendo and other vocal activity such as catcalls or whistles,</li>
            <li>Obscene letters, notes, emails, invitations, photographs, cartoons, articles, or other written or pictorial materials of a sexual nature,</li>
            <li>Discussions or inquiries about sexual fantasy, preferences, history, or sex life about self or others,</li>
            <li>Repeated requests for dates after being informed that interest is unwelcome,</li>
            <li>Retaliating against another for refusing a sexual advance or reporting an incident of possible sexual harassment to the Practice or any government agency,</li>
            <li>Offering or providing favors or employment benefits such as promotions, favorable evaluations, favorable assigned duties or shifts, etc., in exchange for sexual favors,</li>
            <li>Any unwanted physical touching or assaults, or blocking or impeding movements,</li>
            <li>Other harassment.</li>
        </ul>
        Harassment is any unwelcome conduct on the basis of an individual’s actual or perceived age (40 and older), race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, sex, pregnancy (including childbirth, lactation, and related medical conditions), marital status, order of protection status, citizenship status, arrest and conviction information, credit history, crime victim status, physical or mental disability, genetic information (including testing and characteristics), sexual orientation, veteran status, uniformed servicemember status, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local laws, that has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with an individual’s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment. An individual’s work environment is not limited to the physical location where an individual is assigned to perform work duties.<br><br> Again, while it is not possible to list all the circumstances that may constitute other forms of workplace harassment, the following are some examples of conduct that may constitute workplace harassment:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>The use of disparaging or abusive words or phrases, slurs, negative stereotyping, or threatening, intimidating, or hostile acts that relate to the above protected categories,</li>
            <li>Written or graphic material that insults, stereotypes, or shows aversion or hostility toward an individual or group because of one of the above protected categories and that is placed on walls, bulletin boards, email, voicemail, or elsewhere on our premises, or circulated in the workplace,</li>
            <li>A display of symbols, slogans, or items that are associated with hate or intolerance toward any select group.</li>
        </ul>
        Persons covered by this policy include full and part-time employees, interns, contractors, vendors, volunteers, or temporary workers hired by the Practice.</div>

    <h5>Reporting Discrimination and Harassment</h5>
    <div class="q">If an employee believes that they have witnessed or have been subjected to any form of discrimination or harassment, immediately notify People Operations or any member of executive leadership.<br><br> The Practice prohibits retaliation against employees who, based on a reasonable belief, provide information about, complain, or assist in the investigation of any complaint of harassment or discrimination. We will promptly and thoroughly investigate any claim and take appropriate action where we find a claim has merit. To the extent possible, we will retain the confidentiality of those who report suspected or alleged violations of the harassment policy.
        <br><br> Discipline for violation of this policy may include, but is not limited to, reprimand, suspension, demotion, transfer, and discharge. If the Practice determines that harassment or discrimination occurred, corrective action will be taken to effectively end the harassment. As necessary, the Practice may monitor any incident of harassment or discrimination to assure the inappropriate behavior has stopped. In all cases, the Practice will follow up as necessary to ensure that no individual is retaliated against for making a complaint or cooperating with an investigation.
    </div>

    <h5>Investigation Procedure</h5>
    <div class="q">If the Practice receives information that alleges or suggests that an employee has committed an act of sexual harassment or any other form of harassment, the matter shall be referred to People Operations for the purpose of investigating the information or allegation. The Practice shall conduct an immediate investigation of the information or allegation as soon as reasonably possible.<br><br> At the conclusion of the investigation, the investigator will report their findings to the designated official. If the investigator concludes that there is significant evidence that the employee has engaged in any form of harassment, as defined in this policy, then that employee shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. The employee may also be required to participate in counseling, training or other remedial measures.<br><br> The People Operations Officer, or other official designated by the Practice will provide written notice to the employee who filed the complaint and the accused employee informing them of the outcome of the investigation. The notification will not include the recommended discipline in cases where a violation of this policy was found.<br><br> Every employee shall have a duty to cooperate with any investigation initiated by the Practice. Failure to do so may result in disciplinary action. Additionally, every employee has the duty to be truthful and must disclose all information known to the employee when requested to do so by an appropriate person in the organization or the person designated by the organization to investigate an alleged incident of violence. Any employee who fails to be completely truthful or who withholds information shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
    </div>

    <h5>Witnessing Sexual Harassment</h5>
    <div class="q">In addition to having a duty to cooperate with an investigation of sexual harassment, employees who have information about or who witness an act of sexual harassment (or any other form of harassment) against an employee, are <u>required</u> to report all information to People Operations.<br><br> The Practice will not retaliate against, terminate, or discipline any employee for reporting information about alleged incidents of sexual harassment (or any other form of harassment), as defined in this policy that may have been committed by any other employee, including a member of management or executive leadership. Any employee who believes they have been subjected to adverse action as a result of making a report pursuant to this policy should contact People Operations.</div>

    <h5>Statement of Confidentiality</h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice recognizes and respects an employee’s right to privacy and the need for confidentiality and the freedom to make their own decisions. The Practice shall maintain the confidentiality of an employee’s disclosure regarding sexual harassment to the extent allowed by law, and unless to do so would result in physical harm to any person, and/or jeopardize safety within the workplace. When information must be disclosed to protect the safety of individuals within the workplace, the Practice shall limit what information is disclosed as necessary to protect the safety of the disclosing employee and others, and to comply with the law.<br><br> The Practice shall provide advance notice to the employee who disclosed information, to the extent possible, if the disclosure must be shared with other parties in order to maintain safety in the workplace or elsewhere. The Practice shall also provide the employee with the name and title of the person to whom the Practice intends to share the employee’s statements and shall explain why the information must be disclosed.</div>

    <h5>Leave Requests</h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice recognizes that victims of sexual harassment may need time off to obtain or attempt to obtain a protection or restraining order or any other legal assistance to help ensure their health, and safety. The Practice will work in collaboration with the employee to provide reasonable and flexible leave options when an employee is a victim of sexual harassment.<br><br> The Practice will work with the employee to provide paid leave first before requiring an employee to utilize unpaid leave. An employee must provide reasonable advance notice to the employer of the need to take time off unless advance notice is not feasible. To request leave, an employee should contact People Operations. The Practice will maintain the confidentiality of a person who requests leave under this policy, to the extent allowed by law.<br><br> The Practice will also provide reasonable accommodations for a victim of sexual harassment who requests an accommodation for the safety of the victim or to maintain their work performance while at work. Reasonable accommodations may include the implementation of safety measures, including a transfer, reassignment, modified schedule, changed work telephone, changed workstation, installed lock, assistance in documenting the sexual harassment that occurs in the workplace, an implemented safety procedure, another adjustment to a job structure, workplace facility, or work requirement in response to the sexual harassment, or referral to a sexual harassment counseling service. The Practice will assist an employee to enforce his or her protection order, if applicable.
    </div>

    <h5>Resolution Outside Company</h5>
    <div class="q">The purpose of this policy is to establish prompt, thorough, and effective procedures for responding to every complaint and incident so that problems can be identified and remedied internally. However, employees have the right to contact the Illinois Department of Human Rights (IDHR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) about filing a formal complaint. An IDHR complaint must be filed within 180 days of the alleged incident(s) unless it is a continuing offense. A complaint with the EEOC must be filed within three hundred (300) days. In addition, an appeal process is available through the Illinois Human Rights Commission (IHRC), after the IDHR has completed its investigation of the complaint.</div>

    <div id="grad1"><a id="Prac_E">3. Practice Employment Policies & Procedures</a></div>
    <h5><a id="3-Empl">Employment Authorization Verification</a></h5>
    <div class="q">New hires will be required to complete Section 1 of federal Form I-9 on the first day of paid employment and must present acceptable documents authorized by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services proving identity and employment authorization no later than the third business day following the start of employment with the Practice. If an employee is authorized to work in this country for a limited period of time, the employee will be required to submit proof of renewed employment eligibility prior to expiration of that period to remain employed by the Practice.</div>

    <h5><a id="3-NewH">New Hires and Introductory Periods</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The first 90 days of a new hire’s employment is considered an introductory and probationary period. During this period, a new employee will become familiar with the Practice, workplace policies and procedures and job duties and responsibilities. The Practice will have the opportunity to monitor the quality and value of an individual’s performance and make any necessary adjustments to the duties and responsibilities of the position. This period introductory and period with the Practice may be shortened or lengthened as deemed appropriate by management and People Operations. Completion of this introductory and probationary period does not imply guaranteed or continued employment. Nothing that occurs during or after this period should be construed to change the nature of the “at-will” employment relationship.</div>

    <h5><a id="3-RegF">Regular Full-Time Personnel</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Regular full-time employees are those who have completed their introductory and probationary period and are regularly scheduled to work a minimum of 32 hours per week. Unless stated otherwise or specifically permitted by law, all the benefits provided to employees are for regular full-time employees only. This includes vacation, holiday pay, health insurance, and other benefits coverage.</div>

    <h5><a id="3-RegP">Regular Part-Time Personnel</a></h5>
    <div class="q">All employees who work fewer than 32 hours per week are considered part time. Part-time employees are not eligible for benefits unless specified otherwise in this handbook, in the benefit plan summaries, or specifically permitted by law.</div>

    <h5><a id="3-Train">Training Program</a></h5>
    <div class="q">In most cases, and for most departments, onboarding and training new employees is done on an individual basis by the department manager. Even if an employee has had previous experience in the specified functions of the job duties, it is necessary for all new employees to learn our specific processes, procedures, as well as the responsibilities of the specific position. If an employee believes they require additional training, please consult with the Supervisor or Manager.</div><br><br><br>

    <div id="grad1"><a id="Prof">4. Professional Conduct</a></div>
    <h5><a id="4-Conf">Conflicts of Interest</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice is concerned with conflicts of interest that create actual or potential job-related concerns, especially in the areas of confidentiality, customer relations, safety, security, and morale. If there is any actual or potential conflict of interest between an employee and a competitor, supplier, distributor, or contractor to the Practice, the must disclose it to People Operations. If an actual or potential conflict of interest is determined to exist, the Practice will take such steps as it deems necessary to reduce or eliminate the conflict.</div>

    <h5><a id="4-Crim">Criminal Activity/Arrests</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice will report all criminal activity in accordance with applicable law. Involvement in criminal activity while employed by the Practice, whether on or off Practice property, will result in disciplinary action including suspension or termination of employment.</div>

    <h5><a id="4-Pers">Personal Appearance</a></h5>
    <div class="q">An employee’s personal appearance reflects on the reputation, integrity, and public image of the Practice. All employees are required to report to work neatly groomed and dressed. Every employee is expected to maintain personal hygiene habits that are generally accepted in the community, including clean clothing, good grooming and personal hygiene, and appropriate attire for the workplace and the work being performed. All staff at the Practice, regardless of position, are required to wear black scrubs. Providers are required to report in the following: (a) business casual attire with a lab coat; or (b) black scrubs. The uniform requirement does not apply to executive leadership.
        <br><br> Fragrant products, including but not limited to perfumes, colognes, and scented body lotions or hair products, should be used in moderation out of concern for others with sensitivities or allergies.<br><br> The Practice, in accordance with applicable law, will reasonably accommodate employees with disabilities or religious beliefs that make it difficult for them to comply fully with the personal appearance policy unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the Practice. Employees should submit an accommodation request in writing to the Chief Wellness Officer or Director, People Operations to begin the interactive process.<br><br> Failure to comply with the personal appearance standards may result in being sent home to groom or change clothes. Frequent violations may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.</div>

    <h5><a id="4-Stan">Standards of Conduct</a></h5>
    <div class="q">To create a work environment that promotes job satisfaction, respect, responsibility, integrity, and value for all Practice employees, clients, customers, and other stakeholders, all employees share in the responsibility of improving the quality of the work environment. By accepting an offer of employment with the Practice, employees agree to follow all policies, rules, and procedures.<br><br> While it is impossible to list everything that could be considered misconduct in the workplace, outlined here is a list of infractions that may result in discipline, up to and including immediate termination of employment. This policy does not in any way limit the Practice’s right to discipline or discharge an employee for any reason permitted by law.<br><br> Examples of inappropriate conduct include:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Violation of the policies and procedures set forth in this handbook.</li>

            <li>Lending keys or keycards to Practice property to unauthorized persons.</li>
        </ul>

        Nothing in this policy is intended to limit employee rights under the National Labor Relations Act or to modify the at-will employment status.</div>

    <h5><a id="4-Frat">Fraternization and Workplace Relationships</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice strongly believes that a work environment where employees maintain clear boundaries between an employee’s personal and business interactions is necessary for effective business operations. Although this policy does not prevent the development of friendships or romantic relationships between co-workers, it does establish boundaries as to how relationships are conducted during working hours and within the workplace.<br><br> Individuals in supervisory or managerial roles, and those with authority over others’ terms and conditions of employment, are subject to more stringent requirements under this policy due to their status as managers and/or supervisors, their access to sensitive information, and their ability to affect the employment of individuals in subordinate positions.<br>
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Employees that are involved in a romantic relationship with another employee must disclose the existence of the relationship to leadership (Chief Operating Officer and Director, People Operations).</li>
            <li>During working hours and while in the workplace, employees involved in a romantic relationship must conduct themselves in an appropriate manner that does not disrupt the workplace or interfere with each individual’s work productivity.</li>
            <li>During nonworking time, such as lunches, breaks, and before/after work periods, employees engaging in personal exchanges should observe an appropriate workplace manner to avoid offending other employees or putting other employees in an uncomfortable position.</li>
            <li>During working hours, employees are strictly prohibited from engaging in any physical contact that could in any way be deemed inappropriate by a reasonable person while doing business on behalf of the Practice, whether onsite in the workplace or on client or patient premises.</li>
            <li>Employees who allow personal relationships with co-workers to adversely affect the work environment will be subject to the Practice’s disciplinary policy, including counseling for minor problems. Failure to change behavior and/or maintain expected work responsibilities and appropriate workplace conduct and professionalism are viewed as a serious disciplinary matters subject to the Practice’s progressive disciplinary policy.</li>
            <li>Employee off-duty conduct is generally regarded as private, as long as such conduct does not create problems within the workplace. An exception to this principle, however, is romantic or sexual relationships between supervisors and subordinates.</li>
            <li>Any supervisor, manager, executive or any individual in a leadership role must disclose the existence of a romantic or sexual relationship with another employee who is in a similar role. Disclosure may be made to the Chief Wellness Officer, Chief Operating Officer or the Director of People Operations. Leadership will review the circumstances to determine whether any conflict of interest exists. No supervisor, manager, executive or other individual in a leadership role may engage in any romantic or sexual relationship with a subordinate or direct report even if the relationship is deemed consensual. If an employee in any of the aforementioned roles engages in a romantic or sexual relationship with a subordinate or direct report, such action will be grounds for immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment with the Practice.</li>
            <li>When a conflict-of-interest or potential risk of conflict is identified due to an employee’s relationship with another employee, the Practice will work with the parties involved to consider options for resolving the issue. The solution may be to ensure the parties no longer work together on matters where one is able to influence the other or take action for the other. Matters such as hiring, firing, promotions, performance management, compensation decisions and financial transactions are examples of situations that will require reallocation of duties to avoid any actual or perceived reward or disadvantage. In some cases, other measures may be necessary, such as the transfer of one or both parties to other positions or departments. If one or both employees refuse to accept the solution offered by the Practice, such refusal will be deemed a voluntary resignation of one or both employees.</li>
            <li>Failure to cooperate with the Practice to resolve a conflict or problem caused by a romantic or sexual relationship between employees or among managers, supervisors or others in positions of authority may be deemed insubordination and result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.</li>
        </ul>

        The provisions of this policy apply regardless of the sexual orientation of the parties involved. Any concerns about the administration of this policy should be addressed to the Director of People Operations. This policy is not meant to preclude or interfere with the rights of employees protected by the National Labor Relations Act or any other applicable statute concerning the employment relationship.</div>

    <h5><a id="4-Empl">Employment of Relatives or Family Members</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice does not prohibit the hiring of related family members. This policy is intended to ensure effective supervision, internal discipline, trust, and seeks to avoid the appearance of, or potential for conflicts of interest, the appearance of impropriety, and conflicts of loyalty associated with nepotism.<br><br> “Relative or family member” (also referred to as “related persons”), for purposes of this policy, is defined as a familial or other close relationship, whether by blood, adoption, marriage, or domestic partnership (e.g., a spouse, domestic partner, child, grandparent, grandchild, aunt, uncle, brother, sister, first cousin, niece, nephew, any corresponding in-law or step- or foster relation).<br><br> No employee involved in employment decisions may make, participate in, or attempt to influence employment or evaluate decisions involving a relative or closely related person. This policy is intended to prohibit employees who are related from working in direct reporting or supervisory relationships. The policy does not, however, prohibit the Practice from simultaneously employing relatives or closely related persons when the employment relationship does not create a conflict of interest and where the employee has no influence over the terms or conditions of the related person’s employment.<br><br> Where employment would be in conflict with the policy, as stated above, the issue may be avoided by an adjustment of the duties assigned to one or both of the individuals or by modification of the duties of their respective position(s) which will ensure that all employment decisions are made by others. A closely related person may be employed in the same facility, department or team only if all employment decisions with respect to the closely related person are made by a manager or member of executive leadership different from the one to whom the person is related. An employee will not be transferred or promoted into a position which involves employment decisions being made concerning the employee by a relative or closely related person. Individuals with departmental responsibilities who may have conflicting relationships under this policy will not have responsibility for reviewing and approving financial, budgetary, or personnel actions initiated by, recommended by, or affecting a relative or closely related person. Familial or other close relationships should be disclosed to executive leadership or People Operations so that they can be evaluated and managed.<br><br> If after employment an employee enters into one of the above relationships, one of the affected employees must seek a transfer or a change in the reporting relationship. Such changes must be approved by the Chief Wellness Officer. No exception to this policy will be made without the written consent of the Chief Wellness Officer.</div><br><br><br>

    <div id="grad1"><a id="Comp">5. Compensation</a></div>
    <h5><a id="5-Dire">Direct Deposit</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice encourages all employees to enroll in direct deposit. If an employee wishes to enroll in direct deposit, the employee is required to complete the appropriate forms and return to Payroll or People Operations. The Practice utilizes Paychex as its payroll provider. Employees are required to ensure the information in the payroll system is accurate and up to date. This includes mailing address, tax information and other employment related information. An employee may view their paystubs for accuracy and deductions by logging into their personal Paychex account.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-Exem">Exemption Status</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The US. Department of Labor provides general information on the exemption from minimum wage and overtime pay provided by Section 13(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The FLSA provides an exemption from both minimum wage and overtime pay for employees employed as a bona fide executive, administrative, professional and outside sales employees. Individuals who work for the Practice are classified as: Exempt, NonExempt or 1099 Contractor.</div>

    <h5>Exempt Personnel</h5>
    <div class="q">If classified as an exempt employee, an employee is not eligible for overtime pay as otherwise required by federal, state, or local laws. For questions regarding exempt status, an employee should contact Payroll or People Operations for clarification.</div>

    <h5>Nonexempt Personnel</h5>
    <div class="q">A nonexempt employee is eligible for minimum wage and overtime pay in accordance with federal, state, and local laws. For questions regarding nonexempt status, an employee should contact Payroll or People Operations for clarification.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-Meal">Meal and Rest Periods Policy</a></h5>
    <div class="q">A one-hour, paid meal break should be taken each day. An employee’s Manager or Supervisor is responsible for approving the scheduling of this time. For questions related to meal and rest breaks, an employee should speak to their Manager or Supervisor.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-PayP">Pay Period</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The standard pay period is biweekly for all staff. Pay days are on Wednesday. If a pay day falls on a holiday, staff will be paid on the preceding work day. If a staff member is paid by commission, please refer to the commission agreement. Every employee should review their paycheck for accuracy. If there is an issue, please report it to People Operations or Payroll immediately.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-PPra">Pay Practices</a></h5>
    <div class="q">An employee’s pay depends on a wide range of factors, including pay scale surveys, individual effort, skill set, profits, and market forces. If an employee has any questions regarding compensation, including matters such as paid time off, commissions, overtime, benefits, or paycheck deductions, please contact Payroll or People Operations.
    </div>

    <h5><a id="5-Payc">Paycheck Deductions</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice is required by law to make certain deductions from an employee’s pay each pay period. This includes income and unemployment taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) contributions (Social Security and Medicare), and any other deductions required under law or by court order for wage garnishments. The amount of an employee’s tax deductions will depend on earnings and the information an employee listed on their federal Form W-4 and applicable state withholding form. Employees may also authorize voluntary deductions from their paycheck, including contributions for insurance premiums, retirement plans, flexible spending accounts, or other services. Employee deductions will be reflected on their wage statement.<br><br> The Practice will not make any deductions to pay that are prohibited by federal, state, or local law. If an employee has any questions about deductions from their pay, contact Payroll or People Operations. An employee will be reimbursed in full for any isolated, inadvertent, or improper deductions, as defined by law. If an error is found, the employee will receive an immediate adjustment, which will be paid no later than the next regular payday.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-Payr">Payroll Advances and Loans</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Pay advances and/or loans will not be granted to employees.</div>
    <h5><a id="5-Pers">Personal Data Changes</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice utilizes the Paychex HRIS system (Human Resource Information System). The HRIS system is a central repository which holds all employment data. It is an employee’s obligation to update the HRIS system with any changes to contact information, including current mailing address and telephone number. Employees may also make changes to marital or tax withholding status. Failure to do so may result in loss of benefits or delayed receipt of W-2 and other mailings. If an employee has not registered in the Paychex system, whether through computer or mobile application, please do so immediately. If an employee has questions about how to register, please contact People Operations.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-Over">Overtime</a></h5>
    <div class="q">If an employee is classified as nonexempt, the employee may qualify for overtime pay. All overtime must be approved in advance, in writing, by the Manager or Supervisor.<br><br> At certain times, the Practice may require employees to work overtime. Managers and supervisors will attempt to give as much notice as possible in this instance. However, advance notice may not always be possible. Failure to work overtime when requested or working unauthorized overtime will result in discipline, up to and including suspension or termination.<br><br> Unless otherwise required or exempted by law, overtime pay of one and one-half times the regular rate of pay is paid for any hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek. Holidays, vacation days, and sick leave days do not count as time worked for computing overtime.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-Reco">Recording Time</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice is required by applicable federal, state, and local laws to keep accurate records of hours worked by certain employees. To ensure that the Practice has complete and accurate time records and that employees are paid for all hours worked, nonexempt employees are required to record all working time using the time and attendance system. Exempt employees may also be required to track days or time worked. Employees should speak with their Supervisor or Manager for specific instructions.<br><br> Employees must accurately record all time worked to ensure payment for all hours worked and must follow established Practice procedures for recording hours worked. Time must be recorded as follows:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Immediately before starting the shift.</li>
            <li>Immediately after finishing the shift.</li>
            <li>Immediately before and after any other time away from work.</li>
        </ul>

        Employees that are required to clock in/out should clock in no more than five minutes ahead of their scheduled shift and clock out no later than five minutes after their scheduled shift. Employees should notify Payroll of any pay discrepancies, unrecorded or incorrect work hours, or any involuntarily missed meal or break periods.<br><br> Falsifying time entries is strictly prohibited. Falsifying time entries includes working “off the clock.” If an employee is found to have falsified their time records, or the time records of other employees, or if an employee works off the clock, the employee is subject to immediate disciplinary action up to and including an unpaid suspension or termination. Immediately report to the Chief Operating Officer or Director, People Operations any employee, Supervisor, or Manager who falsifies time entries or encourages or requires an employee to falsify time entries or work off the clock.</div>

    <h5><a id="5-Wage">Wage Disclosure Protection</a></h5>
    <div class="q">In accordance with federal and Illinois law, the Practice will not discharge or in any other manner discriminate, discipline or retaliate against any employee for inquiring about, disclosing, comparing, or otherwise discussing wages.
        <br><br> However, if an employee has access to or knowledge of the compensation information regarding other employees as a part of their essential job duties, the employee may not disclose that information to individuals who do not otherwise have access to it, unless the disclosure is:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>In response to a formal complaint or charge;</li>
            <li>Part of an investigation, proceeding, hearing, or action, including an investigation conducted by the Practice; or</li>
            <li>Consistent with the legal duty of the Practice to furnish information.</li>
        </ul>
        If an employee believes that they have been discriminated or retaliated against in violation of this policy, immediately report the concerns to the Director, People Operations. Nothing in this policy is meant to preclude or interfere with the rights of employees protected by the National Labor Relations Act or any other applicable statute concerning the employment relationship.</div><br><br><br>

    <div id="grad1"><a id="Bene">6. Benefits</a></div>
    <h5><a id="6-401k">401(k) Plan</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Eligible employees (as determined by the terms of the plan) may participate in the Practice 401(k) plan. The Practice provides for employee pre-tax deferral contributions, but does not contribute to and/or match employee contributions. To be eligible to enroll in the 401(k) plan, employees must be at least 18 years of age with full-time employment status. This benefit, as well as other benefits, may be canceled or changed at the discretion of the Practice, unless otherwise required by law.</div>

    <h5><a id="6-Heal">Health Insurance</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice offers an employer sponsored health insurance plan through Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Illinois to eligible employees. The Practice also offers dental, vision, and life insurance benefits to all eligible employees and their eligible dependents. Employees are eligible for health benefits the 1st of the month following date of hire. Changes to an employee’s coverage may only be made during open enrollment unless the employee (or dependent) has a qualifying life event (QLE).<br><br> Group health benefits are paid in part by the Practice. The remainder of the costs are paid by the employee through deductions from their paycheck. Benefits may be canceled or changed at the discretion of the Practice, unless otherwise prohibited by law.<br><br> If an employee or a dependent become ineligible for benefits due to a change in work hours or QLE, or the employee leaves employment with the Practice, the employee may have the right to continue their health benefits under federal or state law. In such event, the Practice will provide COBRA information to the employee notifying the employee of their right to continue benefits coverage within fourteen (14) days from the date of separation.</div>

    <h5><a id="6-Shor">Short Term Disability (STD)</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice provides a short-term disability benefit for its employees to provide income replacement for employees unable to work due to illness, pregnancy, or injury. All eligible employees are entitled to short-term disability after six (6) months of continuous employment. The employee must have exhausted all paid leave, including vacation, personal days, and sick leave prior to being approved for short-term disability.<br><br> An employee must provide medical certification and other completed forms relating to the disability leave requested to the Director, People Operations. Once the paperwork is received by People Operations, a claim will be submitted to the insurance provider for approval.<br><br> An employee receiving workers' compensation or disability pay under any state or federal plan is ineligible for this benefit. To be eligible for continued disability benefits, the employee must not engage in outside employment and is expected to avoid activities that may delay recovery and return to work.<br><br> An employee must return to work as soon as permitted by his or her health care provider. The employee must submit a return-to-work clearance to the Director, People Operations.<br><br> Note, all approved short-term disability leave will run concurrently with FMLA.</div>

    <h5><a id="6-Flex">Flexible Spending Account (FSA)</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice offers its employees the option to contribute to an FSA. An FSA allows an employee to pay for eligible health expenses such as copayments, deductibles, and other health related expenses such as prescription medication, certain OTC medications, glasses, and contacts using pretax dollars. Using an FSA reduces the taxes on earned income. Once enrolled, an employee will receive a debit/credit card for use when purchasing eligible items. For more information, please contact People Operations.</div>
    
    <h5><a id="6-Empl">Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</a></h5>
    <div class="q">As part of its comprehensive benefits for employees, the Practice offers employees access to an EAP at no cost to the employee. An EAP offers counseling to employees with issues related to alcohol or substance misuse, caregiver-related stress or needed support, relationship challenges, financial or legal problems, stress, wellness matters and traumatic events like workplace violence. Master’s level clinicians are available 24/7/365 through the EAP to assist employees and provide individual assessments. Employee use of the EAP is strictly confidential and cannot be monitored by the Practice. For more information, please contact People Operations.</div>
    
    <h5><a id="6-Lear">Learning & Development</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice encourages all employees to take advantage of continuing education opportunities. Employees will receive internal trainings on a quarterly basis. Some internal trainings are required for staff to remain in compliance with local and state regulations. The Practice offers financial assistance for certain education related expenses. This benefit is intended to encourage professionalism and assist employees in increasing effectiveness in their position, prepare employees for possible advancement and/or increase an employee’s adaptability to new ideas and change. The Education Reimbursement policy includes assistance with the cost of tuition and required textbooks in pursuit of a degree or for approved certification or licensure. If approved for education reimbursement, all employees are required to sign a repayment agreement. All courses must be approved by a Supervisor or Manager and the Chief Wellness Officer.</div>

    <h5><a id="6-Unem">Unemployment Compensation</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Unemployment compensation insurance is paid for by the Practice and provides temporary income for employees who have lost their job under certain circumstances. Eligibility for unemployment compensation will, in part, be determined by the reasons for an employee’s separation from the Practice.</div>

    <h5><a id="6-Work">Workers’ Compensation</a></h5>
    <div class="q">All employees are entitled to Workers’ Compensation benefits. This coverage is automatic and immediate and protects employees from work-related injury or illness. If an employee cannot work due to a work-related injury or illness, Workers’ Compensation insurance pays the employee’s medical bills and provides a portion of income until the employee can return to work. All on-the-job injuries are covered by the Practice’s Workers' Compensation Insurance Policy, which is provided at no cost. If an employee is injured on the job, no matter how minor, they must report the incident immediately to their manager or supervisor and the Director, People Operations who will complete an Injury Report. Failure to follow Practice procedures may affect the ability of employees to receive Workers Compensation benefits. An employee will be required to submit a medical release before the employee can return to work.</div><br><br><br>

    <div id="grad1"><a id="Paid">7. Paid Time Off & Leaves of Absence</a></div>
    <h5><a id="7-Holi">Holidays</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice observes the following holidays during the year:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>New Year’s Day
                <li>Good Friday</li>
                <li>Memorial Day</li>
                <li>Juneteenth</li>
                <li>Independence Day</li>
                <li>Labor Day</li>
                <li>Thanksgiving Day and the Friday after</li>
                <li>Christmas Eve</li>
                <li>Christmas Day</li>
                <li>New Year’s Eve</li>
        </ul>

        If one of the above holidays falls on Saturday, it is observed on the preceding Friday. If one falls on Sunday, it is observed on the following Monday.<br><br> Eligible employees receive a paid holiday only if the holiday falls on a day they are normally scheduled to work. Full-time and part-time employees are eligible for paid holidays immediately upon hire. Part-time employees are eligible for holiday pay in proportion to the number of hours they normally are scheduled to work.<br><br> Non-exempt employees must work their scheduled work day before and after the holiday period in order to be paid for the holiday unless they are absent with prior permission from their Supervisor or Manager.<br><br> Additionally, all full-time exempt and non-exempt employees will be awarded two (2) floating holidays annually on January 1st . These two floating holidays may be used for religious or cultural holidays, employee birthdays, or other state or federal holidays during which the Practice remains open. The request must be scheduled and approved in advance by the employee's immediate supervisor. Floating holidays may not be carried over to the next calendar year, nor may they be cashed out if not taken or paid upon termination of employment.<br><br> An employee may not take an <i><u>unscheduled</u></i> PTO or sick day the day before or the day after a paid holiday period. In order for an employee to be eligible for holiday pay, the employee is required to work the day before and the day after the specific holiday period if the employee is scheduled. In the absence of mitigating and verifiable circumstances (e.g., family emergency, hospitalization), an employee will not be paid for the holiday.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Paid">Paid Time Off (PTO)</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice recognizes the need for balance in an employee’s work life and personal life. To that end, the Practice encourages eligible employees to utilize PTO to increase productivity and maintain a healthy morale through rest and relaxation.<br><br> Full-time and part-time employees are eligible for paid PTO time. PTO is calculated based on an employee’s anniversary date as follows:<br>

        <ul class="a">
            <li>After completion of the introductory/probationary period, an employee is entitled to 40 hours of PTO annually during the employee’s first two (2) years of employment.</li>
            <li>During an employee’s 2nd through 5th years of employment, an employee is entitled to 80 hours of PTO annually.
            </li>
            <li>After an employee’s 5th year of employment, an employee is entitled to 120 hours of PTO annually.</li>
        </ul>
        In order to preserve continuity and productivity, a department’s coverage must be maintained at all times. PTO requests must be approved in advance by the employee’s Manager or Supervisor to avoid conflicting employee PTO requests. PTO requests will be approved on a first come first served basis. Where a conflict occurs, the efficient operation of the Practice will be the determinate factor in deciding which employee’s PTO request is approved. Part-time employees receive paid PTO time in proportion to the number of hours they are normally scheduled to work.<br><br> An employee must submit a PTO request in writing at least four (4) weeks in advance to their direct Supervisor or Manager for approval. PTO may not be carried over from one year to the next nor is PTO pay granted in lieu of taking the actual time off.<br><br> Upon termination, eligible employees will be paid for accrued but unused PTO.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Sick">Sick Leave</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Any employee who works at least 80 hours for the Practice within any 120-day period is eligible for paid sick leave. Employees begin to accrue paid sick leave on the first calendar day after they begin their employment. For every 40 hours worked, employees accrue one hour of paid sick leave. The Practice provides eligible employees five (5) paid sick days per year. New employees may use paid sick leave 90 calendar days after the start of employment. Sick leave must be used in a minimum increment of four (4) hours which equals a ½ day.<br><br> Sick leave may be used when:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>The employee is physically or mentally ill or injured, or for the purpose of receiving medical care, treatment, diagnosis, or preventative medical care;</li>
            <li>A family member is ill or injured, or for the purpose of receiving medical care, treatment, diagnosis, or preventative medical care;</li>
            <li>The employee or a family member is the victim of domestic violence; or</li>
            <li>The employee’s place of business is closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency, or the employee needs to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency.</li>
        </ul>

        For purposes of this policy, “family member” means child, spouse or domestic partner, parent, spouse or domestic partner's parent, sibling, grandparent, grandchild, or any other individual related by blood or whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship. Adoptive, “step,” foster, and legal guardianship relationships are all included within this definition.<br><br> An employee’s use of sick leave will not be conditioned upon searching for or finding a replacement worker.<br><br> An employee may not take a sick day the day before or the day after a paid holiday period. In order for an employee to be eligible for holiday pay, the employee is required to work the day before and the day after the specific holiday period if the employee is scheduled. In the absence of mitigating and verifiable circumstances (e.g., doctor’s note, hospital admission), an employee will not be paid for the holiday.<br><br> If an employee is absent from work for more than three (3) consecutive days, the employee must provide documentation signed by a licensed health care provider OR a police report, court document, signed statement from an attorney, or any other evidence that supports the reason for the absence. When the use of sick leave is reasonably foreseeable (e.g., pre-scheduled health care appointments or court dates in a domestic violence case), the employee is required to provide up to five (5) days’ notice before leave is taken to their immediate supervisor. When the use of sick leave is not reasonably foreseeable, the employee is required to provide notice to their immediate Supervisor or Manager as soon as is practicable on the day he/she intends to take earned sick leave.<br><br> Employees may carry over up to twenty (20) hours of unused sick leave to the following year (for a total of sixty (60) hours), except an employee on FMLA may carry over up to forty (40) hours to be used exclusively for FMLA purposes with a maximum usage of sixty (60) hours per year. Unused earned sick leave will not be paid at separation or termination of employment. When employees use sick leave while on FMLA, the notice and documentation and certification requirements under the FMLA, and any other applicable provisions of the FMLA, take precedence to the extent they conflict with a provision of this policy.<br><br> The Practice prohibits retaliation against employees for requesting or using earned sick leave. Employees who believe that their legal rights have been violated are encouraged to contact People Operations.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Bere">Bereavement Leave</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The death of a family member is a time when employees wish to be with their families. Full-time and part-time employees are eligible immediately upon hire for three (3) paid days of bereavement leave for the death of an immediate family member. Members of the immediate family include spouses, parents, brothers, sisters, children, grandchildren, grandparents, parents-in-law and domestic partners and their parents. Part-time employees are eligible for bereavement pay in proportion to the number of hours they normally are scheduled to work.<br><br> Effective January 1, 2023, eligible employees may use up to two (2) weeks of <u>unpaid</u> bereavement leave to:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Attend the funeral (or an alternative to a funeral) of a covered family member:</li>
            <in>Child or stepchild</in><br>
            <in>Spouse or domestic partner</in><br>
            <in>Sibling</in><br>
            <in>Parent, stepparent, mother-in-law, or father-in-law; or grandchild or grandparent</in><br>
            <li>Plan arrangements necessitated by the death of a covered family member;</li>
            <li>Grieve the death of a covered family member; or</li>
            <li>Be absent from work because of a miscarriage and other unsuccessful pregnancy and/or adoption and fertility outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        Employee eligibility for this benefit mirrors the FMLA requirements as this is an extension of the FMLA. The leave must be completed within sixty (60) days of the employee receiving notice of the death of a covered family member or within sixty (60) days of the date of the covered event. If an employee experiences the death of more than one family member in a 12-month period, the employee is entitled to up to a total of six weeks of bereavement leave during the 12-month period. Requests for bereavement leave should be made to the People Operations as soon as possible.<br><br>
        <i>Note: Illinois state law does not create a right for unpaid leave that exceeds the unpaid leave allowed under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Therefore, if an employee exhausts all of their FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month period, the Practice is not required to provide additional bereavement leave.</i></div>

    <h5><a id="7-Leav">Leave for Domestic, Sexual or Gender Violence Leave</a></h5>
    <div class="q">In accordance with the Illinois Victims' Economic Security and Safety Act, employees who are the victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, gender violence or any other crime of violence or who have family or household members who are the victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, gender violence or any other crime of violence whose interests are not adverse to the employee as it relates to the domestic violence, sexual violence, gender violence or any other crime of violence, may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave within any 12- month period, and upon return will be restored to the same or an equivalent position.<br><br> Employees may elect to substitute any or all annual or vacation leave, personal leave and sick leave during the otherwise unpaid leave. This substitution of paid leave does not extend the total allowed leave period but runs concurrently with it. Leave under this policy also runs concurrently with Family and Medical Leave when the reason for the leave qualifies for Family and Medical Leave, such as for a serious health condition. In these situations, the leave does not extend any unpaid time available to the employee under Family and Medical Leave.<br><br>
        <u>Reasons for Leave</u><br> Eligible employees may take leave under this policy so that they or a member of their family or household may take part in one or more of the following actions:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>seek medical attention for or recover from physical or psychological injuries caused by domestic violence, sexual violence, gender violence or any other crime of violence;</li>
            <li>obtain services from a victim's services organization;</li>
            <li>obtain psychological or other counseling;</li>
            <li>participate in safety planning, including temporary or permanent relocation, or other actions to increase their physical safety or economic security; or</li>
            <li>seek legal assistance or remedies to ensure their health and safety, including preparing for or participating in any civil or criminal legal proceeding related to or derived from domestic violence, sexual violence, gender violence or any other crime of violence.</li>
        </ul>
        For purposes of this policy, "family or household member" means a spouse or party to a civil union, parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, sibling, or any other person related by blood or by present or prior marriage or civil union, other person who shares a relationship through a child, or any other individual whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship as determined by the employee and persons jointly residing in the same household.<br><br> Eligible employees must provide the Practice with at least 48 hours advance notice of the need for leave unless such notice is not practicable.<br><br>
        <u>Certification of the Need for Leave</u><br> To request leave, the employee must supply the Practice with a sworn statement from the employee that the employee or a family or household member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, gender violence or any other crime of violence and that leave is necessary for one of the reasons described above.<br><br> The employee seeking leave also must provide supporting documentation from one of the following sources if the employee has possession of such document:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>a victim's services organization;</li>
            <li>a member of the clergy;</li>
            <li>an attorney;</li>
            <li>a medical or other professional from which the employee or family or household member has sought assistance;
            </li>
            <li>a police report or court record; or</li>
            <li>any other corroborating evidence.</li>
        </ul>

        All information and documentation an employee provides in connection with a request for leave under this policy, including the fact that the employee requested and/or obtained leave, will be held in the strictest confidence — except to the extent the employee requests or consents to any disclosure in writing, or as otherwise required by law. Further, the Practice specifically prohibits any discrimination, harassment, or retaliation against employees who request or take leave under this policy in good faith.<br><br> During leave, an employee must provide periodic reports (at least every 30 days) about their status and any change in the employee’s plans to return to work.<br><br> During an approved domestic violence leave, the Practice will maintain an employee’s health benefits as if the employee continues to be actively employed. If an employee chooses not to return to work at the end of the leave period, the employee must reimburse the Practice for the cost of any health benefit premiums paid to maintain the health coverage during the leave, unless an employee cannot return to work because of continuation, reoccurrence, or onset of domestic or sexual violence or other circumstances beyond the employee’s control.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Jury">Jury Duty Leave</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice encourages employees to fulfill their civic duties related to jury duty. If an employee is summoned for jury duty, the employee must notify the Practice by providing a copy of the summons to the Supervisor or Manager within ten (10) days of receipt of the summons.<br><br> An employee will be granted an unpaid leave of absence to attend jury duty. The employee must make scheduling arrangements with their Supervisor or Manager. If an employee is classified as exempt, the employee will not incur any deduction in pay for a partial week’s absence due to jury duty. If an employee is classified as nonexempt, the employee will not be compensated for time spent on jury duty. If a nonexempt employee has PTO available, the employee may use PTO while serving on jury duty.<br><br> The Practice reserves the right to require employees to provide proof of jury duty service to the extent authorized by law. The Practice will not retaliate against employees who request or take leave in accordance with this policy.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Witn">Witness Leave</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Employees called to serve as a witness in a judicial proceeding must notify their Supervisor or Manager as soon as possible. Employees will not be compensated for time away from work to participate in a court case, but may use available PTO to cover the period of absence. Employees attending judicial proceedings in response to a subpoena will not be disciplined for their absence.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Voti">Voting Leave</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Employees who are eligible to vote in an election may request up to two (2) hours with pay to vote while polls are open. Employees must notify the Practice of their intention to take time off to vote at least one (1) week prior to Election Day.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Scho">School Visitation Leave</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Parents and guardians having custody of schoolchildren from kindergarten through Grade 12 are provided up to eight (8) hours per year of unpaid time off (not to exceed four (4) hours in any single day) to attend school conferences or classroom activities related to the child if the conference or classroom activities cannot be scheduled during nonwork hours. The Practice may require proof that the employee attended school conferences or classroom activities related to the child. Employees first must exhaust all accrued paid time off, then they may take unpaid time off for this purpose. However, employees will be given the opportunity to make up any lost work time. Seven (7) days' written notice (except in emergency situations when 24-hours' notice is sufficient) must be given to the Supervisor or Manager before taking any time off for school children. Employees must consult with the Practice to schedule their leave so as not to unduly disrupt operations.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Mili">Military Leave (USERRA)</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice complies with applicable federal and state law regarding military leave and re-employment rights. Unpaid military leave of absence will be granted to members of the uniformed services in accordance with the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA; with amendments) and all applicable state law. An employee must submit documentation of the need for leave to their Supervisor or Manager. When returning from military leave of absence, an employee will be reinstated to their previous position or a similar position, in accordance with state and federal law. An employee must notify their Supervisor or Manager of their intent to return to employment based on requirements of the law. For more information regarding status, compensation, benefits, and reinstatement upon return from military leave, contact the Supervisor or Manager or People Operations.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Fami">Family Military Leave Act</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice will grant eligible employees up to 30 days of unpaid family military leave if their spouse or child is called to military service with the State or the United States for more than 30 days. Family military leave must be taken during the time federal or state deployment orders are in effect. To be eligible, the employee must have been employed for at least twelve (12) months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the request for family military leave. Employees may take family military leave only if they have exhausted all accrued vacation, personal, compensatory, and other leave, except sick and disability leave.<br><br> The request for leave must be made at least fourteen (14) days in advance if the leave will consist of five (5) or more consecutive workdays. If the leave will consist of less than five (5) days, the request must be made with as much advance notice as is practicable. All requests must be submitted in writing to the People Operations Department.
    </div>

    <h5><a id="7-Volu">Voluntary Emergency Workers</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice will not discharge employees who serve as volunteer emergency workers and are absent from or late to work due to their participation in an emergency situation. Volunteer emergency workers include volunteer firefighters, emergency medical technicians, ambulance drivers or attendants, first responders, members of county municipal emergency services and disaster agencies, and auxiliary policemen or deputies. Employees must make a reasonable effort to notify the Practice that they may be absent from or late to work.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-FMLA">Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</a></h5>
    <div class="q">It is the policy of the Practice comply with the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA). FMLA provides certain employees with up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year. It also requires that an employee’s group health benefits be maintained during the leave. FMLA is designed to help employees balance their work and family responsibilities by allowing them to take reasonable unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons. It also seeks to accommodate the legitimate interests of employers and promote equal employment opportunity for men and women.<br><br> Employees are considered eligible for leave if they have worked for the Practice at least twelve (12) months, with at least 1,250 hours over the past twelve (12) months. All requests for leaves of absence should be submitted in writing to the Director, People Operations.<br><br> FMLA provides eligible employees up to twelve (12) weeks of unpaid leave each year for any of the following reasons:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>for the birth and care of the newborn child of an employee</li>
            <li>for placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care</li>
            <li>to care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition or</li>
            <li>to take medical leave when the employee is unable to work because of a serious health condition because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that an employee's spouse, son, daughter or parent is a covered military member on covered active duty or called to covered active-duty status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to covered active duty) in the Reserves component of the Armed Forces in support of contingency operations or Regular Armed Forces for deployment to a foreign country. This leave is also available for family members of active-duty service members.</li>
        </ul>

        FMLA leave usually will be taken for a period of consecutive days, weeks, or months. However, employees are entitled to take FMLA leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when medically necessary due to a serious health condition of the employee or covered family member or the serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember.
        <br><br> The taking of another job while on family/medical leave or any other authorized leave of absence is grounds for immediate termination, to the extent permitted by law.<br><br> During FMLA leave, eligible employees are entitled to receive group health plan coverage (if applicable) on the same terms and conditions as if they had continued to work. Employees may still be required to pay the employee portion of the group health insurance premium.<br><br> Employees requesting FMLA leave are entitled to receive written notice from the Practice telling them whether they are eligible for FMLA leave and, if not eligible, the reasons why they are not eligible. When eligible for FMLA leave, employees are entitled to receive written notice of:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>their rights and responsibilities in connection with such leave;</li>
            <li>the Practice's designation of leave as FMLA-qualifying or non-qualifying, and if not FMLA-qualifying, the reasons why; and</li>
            <li>the amount of leave, if known, that will be counted against the employee's leave entitlement.</li>
        </ul>

        Employees must provide 30 days' advance notice of the need to take FMLA leave when the need is foreseeable. When 30 days' notice is not possible, or the approximate timing of the need for leave is not foreseeable, employees must provide the Practice written notice of the need for leave as soon as practicable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case. Employees, who fail to give 30 days' notice for foreseeable leave without a reasonable excuse for the delay, or otherwise fail to satisfy FMLA notice obligations, may have FMLA leave delayed or denied.<br><br> When employees take intermittent or reduced work schedule leave for foreseeable planned medical treatment for the employee or a family member, including during a period of recovery from a serious health condition or to care for a covered servicemember, the Practice may temporarily transfer employees, during the period that the intermittent or reduced leave schedules is required, to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits for which the employee is qualified and which may better accommodate recurring periods of leave.<br><br> In addition to the basic FMLA leave entitlement outlined above, an eligible employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of a “covered servicemember” is entitled to take up 26 weeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for the servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Leave to care for a servicemember shall only be available during a single-12 month period and, when combined with other FMLAqualifying leave, may not exceed 26 weeks during the single 12-month period. The single 12-month period begins on the first day an eligible employee takes leave to care for the injured servicemember.<br><br> A "covered servicemember" is a current member of the Armed Forces, including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in outpatient status or is on the temporary retired list, for a serious injury or illness. These individuals are referred to in this policy as “current members of the Armed Forces.”<br><br> Covered servicemembers also include a veteran who is discharged or released from military services under condition other than dishonorable at any time during the five (5) years preceding the date the eligible employee takes FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran, and who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. These individuals are referred to in this policy as “covered veterans.”<br><br> If an employee is approved for FMLA, the employee may be responsible for paying the employee portion of all health insurance premiums. If an employee fails pay to the monthly premium payment in a timely manner, the Practice will provide the employee with information about their rights under COBRA and/or applicable state continuation coverage policies. An employee who fails to make the employee portion of health insurance premiums may be terminated from the group plan.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Pers">Personal Leave of Absence</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice recognizes that an employee may need time off from work due to special circumstances that other leave policies may not address. In such cases, an employee may request an unpaid personal leave of absence. All regular/full-time/part-time employees employed for at least one (1) year are eligible to apply for a 30-day unpaid personal leave of absence. Requests for an unpaid personal leave must be submitted to the Director, People Operations in writing at least twenty (20) business days in advance. In an emergency situation, written notice must be provided as soon as possible. The request should include the reason for the leave as well as the dates an employee expects to begin and end the leave.<br><br> Job performance, absenteeism, and department/business needs will be taken into consideration before a request is approved. Requests for unpaid personal leave may be denied or granted for any reason and are within the sole discretion of the Practice.<br><br> An employee will be required to use all available paid time off (PTO) prior to taking an unpaid personal leave of absence. Sick leave, PTO, seniority, or other benefits will not accrue during an unpaid personal leave of absence. Holidays that occur during an unpaid personal leave of absence will not be paid.<br><br> If an employee is granted a personal leave of absence, reinstatement to the employee’s current position or any position is not guaranteed.<br><br> The Practice’s employer-sponsored group health benefits will be continued at the same level and under the same conditions as prior to the leave, for up to thirty (30) days. An employee is responsible for payment of the employee portion of the insurance premium while on personal leave.<br><br> If an employee is on a personal leave of absence that exceeds thirty (30) days or the employee fails to pay the premium payment in a timely manner, the Practice will provide the employee with information about their rights under COBRA and/or applicable state continuation coverage policies.<br><br>
        <u>Extension of Leave</u><br> An employee is required to return from unpaid personal leave on the originally scheduled return date. If an employee is unable to return, the employee must request an extension of the leave in writing at least two (2) weeks in advance of the return date. Leave extensions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If the Practice denies the extension request, an employee must return to work on the originally scheduled return date or the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned their employment with the Practice.<br><br>
        <u>Return to Work</u><br> In advance of an employee’s scheduled return to work date, People Operations will arrange for the employee to resume their previous position, if available. However, the Practice’s need to fill a position may override the ability to hold a position open until an employee’s return. Therefore, the Practice will not guarantee an employee’s ability to return to the same position or any position after the approved leave. The Practice in its sole discretion will determine the availability of any similar positions based on an employee’s qualifications. If the Practice is unable to reinstate an employee or if the employee refuses an offer of reinstatement in a different position, the employee’s leave status will be deemed a voluntary termination.<br><br>
        <u>Failure to Return from Leave</u><br> If an employee fails to return to work after an unpaid leave of absence, the employee will be considered to have voluntarily resigned their employment.</div><br>

    <h6>Alternative Employment on Leave</h6>
    <div class="q">While an employee is on any unpaid leave of absence, the employee may not work or be gainfully in any outside employment unless express, written permission to perform such outside work has been granted by the Practice. If an employee is on a leave of absence and is found to be working elsewhere without permission, the employee is subject to immediate disciplinary action up to and including termination.</div>

    <h5><a id="7-Work">Workplace Accommodations</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and all applicable state and local fair employment practice laws, and is committed to providing equal employment opportunities to qualified individuals with disabilities, including disabilities related to pregnancy, childbirth, and related conditions. The Practice will provide reasonable accommodation to otherwise qualified individuals where appropriate to allow the individual to perform the essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create an undue hardship on the business.<br><br> If an employee requires an accommodation due to a disability, it is the employee’s responsibility to request the accommodation in writing to the Director, People Operations. The employee may be asked to include relevant information such as:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>A description of the proposed accommodation.</li>
            <li>The reason an accommodation is needed.</li>
            <li>How the accommodation will help the employee perform the essential functions of their job.</li>
        </ul>
        After receiving the request, the Practice will engage in the interactive process with an employee to determine the precise limitations of the employee’s disability and explore potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations. Where appropriate, the Practice may require the employee’s permission to obtain additional information from their medical provider. All medical information received by the Practice in connection with a request for accommodation will be treated as strictly confidential.<br><br> The Practice encourages an employee to suggest specific reasonable accommodations that they believe would allow them to perform their job duties. However, the Practice is not required to make the specific accommodation requested by the employee and may provide an alternative accommodation, to the extent any reasonable accommodation can be made without imposing an undue hardship on the Practice.<br><br> If leave is provided as a reasonable accommodation, such leave may run concurrently with leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and/or any other leave where permitted by state and federal law. The Practice will not discriminate or retaliate against employees for requesting an accommodation.</div><br>

    <h6>Accommodations for Nursing Mothers</h6>
    <div class="q">The Practice will provide nursing mothers reasonable paid break time to express milk for their infant child(ren) for up to one (1) year following the child’s birth. If an employee is nursing, they will be provided with a space, other than a restroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public.<br><br> Expressed milk may be stored in a company refrigerator or personal cooler and must be sufficiently marked or labeled to avoid confusion for other employees who may share the refrigerator. Break time should, if possible, be taken concurrently with any other break time already provided. Employees are encouraged to discuss the length and frequency of these breaks with their Supervisor or Manager.</div><br>
    <h6>Religious Accommodation</h6>
    <div class="q">The Practice is dedicated to treating its employees equally and with respect and recognizes the diversity of religious beliefs. Any employees may request an accommodation when their religious beliefs cause a deviation from the Practice’s dress code or the individual’s schedule, basic job duties, or other aspects of employment. The Practice will consider the request, but reserves the right to offer its own accommodation to the extent permitted by law. Some, but not all, of the factors that will be considered are cost, the effect that an accommodation will have on current established policies, and the burden on operations, including other employees, when determining a reasonable accommodation. At no time will the Practice question the validity of a person’s religious beliefs. If an employee requires a religious accommodation, an employee should submit the request to the Director, People Operations.
    </div><br><br><br>
    
    <div id="grad1"><a id="Atte">8. Attendance & Punctuality</a></div>
    <h5><a id="8-Atte">Attendance Policy</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Attendance and punctuality are key factors in an employee’s job performance. Punctuality and regular attendance are expected of all employees. Excessive unexcused absences, tardiness or leaving early is unacceptable and strictly prohibited.<br><br> When scheduled, an employee is expected to report to work on time at the beginning of their scheduled shift, ready to work. The inability to report to work on time as scheduled may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, for violation of the Practice’s attendance policy or job abandonment.<br><br> If an employee knows ahead of time that they will be absent or late, the employee must provide reasonable advance notice to their Supervisor or Manager. An employee may be required to provide documentation of any medical reason or other excuse for being absent or late for their scheduled shift.<br><br> The Practice reserves the right to apply unused PTO or sick leave to unauthorized absences. Absences resulting from approved leave are exceptions to this policy. Employees are expected to remain at work for their entire shift as scheduled. Late arrival, early departure or other absences from scheduled hours are disruptive and must be avoided.
        <br><br> This policy does not apply to absences covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) or leave provided as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). These exceptions are described in separate policies.</div><br>

    <h6>Absences</h6>
    <div class="q">“Absence” is defined as the failure of an employee to report for work when he or she is scheduled to work. The two types of absences are defined below:<br><br> An excused absence occurs when all the following conditions are met:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>The employee provides to their Supervisor or Manager sufficient notice at least 48 hours in advance of the absence.</li>
            <li>The absence request is approved in advance by the employee’s Supervisor or Manager.</li>
            <li>The employee has sufficient accrued paid time off (PTO) to cover the absence.</li>
        </ul>
        An unexcused absence occurs when any of the above conditions are not met. If it is necessary for an employee to be absent or late for work because of an illness or an emergency, the employee must notify his or her Supervisor or Manager no later than one (1) hour before the employee’s scheduled starting time on that same day. If an employee is unable to call, the employee must have another individual notify their Supervisor or Manager.<br><br> When reporting an absence, an employee should indicate the nature of the problem causing the absence and their expected return to work date. A physician’s statement is required for any illness related absence in excess of three (3) consecutive work days. In the event of an emergency, an employee must notify their Supervisor or Manager as soon as possible reasonably practicable.<br><br> An unexcused absence is a violation of the Practice’s attendance policy and will result in a verbal warning for the first occurrence. Employees with three (3) or more consecutive days of excused absences because of illness or injury must give the Practice proof of physician’s care and a fitness for duty release prior to returning to work. While proof of physician’s care and/or a fitness for duty release may explain the employee’s absence, it does not excuse the absence and an occurrence may still occur.<br><br> If available, an employees must use earned PTO or sick leave for every absence according to Practice policy.<br><br> Excessive absences, tardiness or leaving early are grounds for disciplinary action, which may include a verbal warning, written warning, suspension without pay, and/or termination. Depending on the circumstances, including the employee’s length of employment, the Practice may counsel an employee prior to termination for excessive absences, tardiness or leaving early, in accordance with the Practice’s corrective disciplinary procedures.</div><br>
    <h6>Attendance During New Hire Orientation Period</h6>
    <div class="q">A new employee, within their probationary period, who has two (2) or more absences will receive a written warning. If a new employee, within their probationary period, has more than two (2) absences, their probationary period may be extended or their employment with the Practice may be terminated.</div><br>
    <h6>Occurrences</h6>
    <div class="q">An occurrence is documented as any unapproved absence, tardy, leave early, or missed time clock in/out that is not approved in advance by an employee’s Supervisor or Manager.</div><br>
    <h6>Tardiness and Early Departures</h6>
    <div class="q">Employees are required to return from scheduled breaks on time. Employees, when scheduled, are required to work to the end of their scheduled shift. Employees who must leave work before the end of their scheduled shift must notify their Supervisor or Manager immediately. An employee who violates this policy is subject to disciplinary action which may include a written warning, suspension without pay, or termination of employment.<br><br> An employee is deemed to be tardy when:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>The employee fails to report for work at the assigned/scheduled work time; or</li>
            <li>The employee takes an extended meal or break period without prior approval from their Supervisor or Manager.
            </li>
        </ul>
        An employee is deemed to have an early departure when:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>The employee leaves work prior to the end of assigned/scheduled work time without prior approval from their Supervisor or Manager.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h6>Time Clocks and Failure to Clock In/Out</h6>
    <div class="q">Employees are required to follow established guidelines for recording their actual hours worked. A missed clock in/out is a violation of this policy and includes:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Failure to clock in/out at the beginning and/or end of their assigned shift;</li>
            <li>Failure to clock in/out on their designated time clock for the meal break;</li>
            <li>Failure to accurately report time worked; or</li>
            <li>Clocking in/out early (or late) of assigned shift without prior approval</li>
    </div>

    <h5><a id="8-Depa">Departmental Notification Procedure</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Employees are expected to follow departmental notification procedures if they will be late for work, will not be at work, or are requesting planned time away from work. Employees must submit time off requests in advance to their Supervisor or Manager in accordance with departmental procedures.<br><br> At the time of notification, the employee must notify their Supervisor or Manager when an absence is due to a documented/approved leave of absence (e.g., Military Leave, FMLA) in order to ensure appropriate tracking of leave utilization and absenteeism. Incidents of not following the departmental notification procedures, including No-Call/No-Show, will be addressed in accordance with the Progressive Discipline policy.</div>

    <h5><a id="8-DepP">Departmental Policy Approval Process</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Practice departments may develop a departmental attendance/punctuality policy that meets the unique operational needs of the department. If executive leadership determines that a departmental policy is needed, the department will follow its approval process to establish the policy which requires final approval from executive leadership. This policy is intended as a guideline to assist in the consistent application of policies and programs for employees. The policy does not create a contract implied or expressed, with any Practice employees, who are employees at will. The Practice reserves the right to modify this policy in whole or in part, at any time, at the discretion of the Practice.</div>

    <h5><a id="8-Disc">Disciplinary Action</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Excessive absenteeism is defined as two (2) or more occurrences of unexcused absences within a 30-day period and will result in disciplinary action. Excessive tardiness or absenteeism is subject to disciplinary action up to and including suspension without pay and/or termination of employment.<br><br> Employees who are absent without notification (No Call/No Show) to their Supervisor or Manager are subject to immediate disciplinary action which may include suspension without pay or immediate termination of employment with the Practice.<br><br> Supervisors and Managers are expected to monitor their direct reports’ attendance on a regular basis and address unsatisfactory attendance in a timely and consistent manner. If the Supervisor or Manager notices a pattern of unscheduled usage of accrued time off banks, they should discuss the concern with the employee.<br><br> When an employee has been previously counseled under the Progressive Discipline Policy the totality of the circumstances will be assessed when determining further disciplinary action. For situations involving suspension or termination of employment, the Supervisor or Manager should consult with People Operations prior to implementing disciplinary action.<br><br> Timely and regular attendance is a part of job performance and it is the expectation that all Practice employees must follow established attendance policies. Consequently, employees who have exhibited unsatisfactory attendance which results in disciplinary action (whether verbal or written) may have the behavior documented during their annual performance evaluation.</div>

    <h5><a id="8-Holi">Holidays</a></h5>
    <div class="q">If an employee calls out of work the day before or the day after a paid Practice holiday, the employee if eligible will not receive holiday pay. The employee may also be subject to progressive disciplinary action.</div><br><br><br>

    <div id="grad1"><a id="Perf">9. Performance Management</a></div>
    <h5><a id="9-Prog">Progressive Disciplinary Process</a></h5>
    <div class="q">Violation of Practice policies or procedures may result in disciplinary action including demotion, transfer, leave without pay, or termination of employment. The Practice encourages a system of progressive discipline depending on the type of prohibited conduct. However, the Practice is not required to engage in progressive discipline and may discipline or terminate employees who violate employment policies and procedures. An attempt at progressive disciplinary action does not imply that employment is anything other than on an “at-will” basis.
        <br><br> In appropriate circumstances, management will first provide an employee with a verbal warning, then proceed to the next step in the progressive disciplinary process. If an employee’s behavior is not sufficiently altered, eventual demotion, transfer, forced leave, or termination of employment will occur.
        <ul class="a">
            <li><strong>Coaching</strong> is the first step in the progressive disciplinary process and is a useful tactic that may help deal with challenges before they become issues. Coaching is a conversation with an employee wherein the Supervisor or Manager speaks with the employee about a performance gap or expectations not being met relating to the employee’s job duties. Coaching may be documented.</li>
            <li><strong>Verbal Warnings</strong> are used to address relatively minor performance deficiencies or issues that may lead to additional corrective action if an employee fails to take decisive action and correct the behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>Written Warnings</strong> are intended to address more serious and/or frequent deficiencies and make the employee aware that continued employment is at risk if immediate and lasting improvement does not occur.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Final Warnings</strong> are issued if an employee’s performance does not improve following a Written Warning or if the performance deficiencies are more severe than those appropriate for a Verbal or Written Warning. In certain circumstances, a Final Warning may be given to address a serious performance deficiency wherein continued recurrence of the behavior will result in termination of employment.</li>
        </ul>
        Supervisors and Managers will make every effort possible to allow an employee to respond to any disciplinary action taken. While the Practice will attempt to be consistent in the enforcement of its policies, the Practice is not obligated to follow any disciplinary or grievance procedure and depending on the circumstances, an employee may be disciplined or terminated without any prior warning or procedure.<br><br> Behavior that is illegal is not subject to corrective discipline, and such behavior may be reported to local law enforcement authorities. Similarly, theft, substance abuse, intoxication, fighting and other acts of violence in the workplace or at a Practice-sponsored event are also not subject to corrective discipline and may be grounds for immediate termination.</div>

    <h5><a id="9-Perf">Performance Evaluations</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice will review each employee’s work performance. At the end of an employee’s initial 90-day introductory/probationary period, the employee’s direct Supervisor or Manager will evaluate an employee’s performance for continued employment.<br><br> Regular full-time and part-time employees will receive an annual performance evaluation. The performance evaluation process is a means for increasing the quality of an employee’s performance and to provide feedback in needed areas of improvement. An employee’s initiative, effort, attitude, job knowledge, and other factors will be addressed. An employee must understand that a positive performance review does not guarantee a pay raise or continued employment. Pay raises and promotions are based on many factors, including job performance.</div>

    <h5><a id="9-Bonu">Bonus Compensation</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice provides bonus compensation to eligible employees. To be eligible for the bonus payment, an employee:
        <ul class="a">
            <li>Must have been employed as of July 1st of the bonus plan year.</li>
            <li>Must have a minimum of “meets expectations” in all performance categories of the employee’s annual performance evaluation.</li>
            <li>Must be employed with the Practice as of December 31st of the bonus plan year.</li>
            <li>Must be employed with the Practice at the time bonus payments are made to eligible employees.</li>
        </ul>
        Each eligible employee’s bonus is calculated as a percentage of base salary received as of year-end. Bonus payments will range from 3%-8% of an employee’s base salary. An employee’s performance, tenure, and overall contribution to the success and profitability of the Practice are utilized in determining an employee’s bonus payment. Employee bonus payments are authorized at the sole discretion of the Chief Wellness Officer.<br><br> Note, employee bonus compensation is based on year-end profits of the Practice. If the Practice is not profitable in a given year, no bonus payments will be made to any employee.</div><br><br><br>

    <div id="grad1"><a id="Work">10. Workplace Policies & Procedures</a></div>
    <h5><a id="10-Acce">Access to Personnel and Medical Records Files</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice maintains separate medical records files and personnel files for all employees. Files containing medical records are stored separate and apart from any business-related records in a safe, locked, inaccessible location. The medical file is the repository for sensitive and confidential information related to an individual’s health, health benefits, health-related leave and/or accommodations, benefits selections and coverage. Medical records are kept confidential in compliance with applicable laws and access is on a “need-to-know” basis only.<br><br> Supervisors, Managers and others in management may have access to personnel files for employment-related decisions. If an employee wishes to review their personnel or medical records file, an employee may submit the request in writing to the Director, People Operations. After submitting the written request, an employee may review their personnel and/or medical documents within ten (10) business days. Any inspection must occur in the presence of a Practice representative.<br><br> All requests by an outside party for information contained in an employee’s personnel file, and/or for copies, must be directed to the People Operations Department, which is the only department authorized to provide such information.
    </div>

    <h5><a id="10-Bull">Bulletin Boards</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice maintains an official bulletin board in Practice facilities to provide employees with official Practice notices, including wage and hour laws, changes in policies, and other employment-related notices. At times the Practice may also post information of general interest to employees on the bulletin board. Each employee is responsible for being informed about this material by periodically reviewing the bulletin board. Only authorized personnel may add and remove notices from the bulletin board.</div>

    <h5><a id="10-Incl">Inclement Weather/Emergencies</a></h5>
    <div class="q">The Practice recognizes that inclement weather and other emergencies may affect an employee’s ability to get to work. In such situations, an employee’s safety is paramount. If an employee is unable to safely travel to work for their scheduled shift, the employee must notify their Supervisor or Manager. If the employee has PTO available, the employee may be charged PTO to cover the absence.</div><br>

    <h6>Company Closure</h6>
